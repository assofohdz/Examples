Project is un-archived - lets see if we can push some more into this game :D

# Subspace Infinity
A java port of Subspace Continuum, built on JME, Lemur, Zay-ES, Zay-ES-Net, SpiderMonkey, and the SimEthereal real-time
object synching library.  This modifies the sim-eth-basic to be ES based using the Zay-ES library.

## Acknowledgments

Big thanks to the JME community and Paul Speed who has laid the foundation with the awesome Zay-ES framework and his game example.

Thanks to the Subspace/Continuum developers who keeps the game alive. If not for them, this java port would not be here.
