## Acknowledgments

Big thanks to the [jMonkeyEngine community](https://hub.jmonkeyengine.org/) for tremendous help and [Paul Speed](https://github.com/pspeed42) who has laid the foundation with the awesome:

- [Zay-ES + Zay-ES-Net framework](https://github.com/jMonkeyEngine-Contributions/zay-es)
- [SiO2 framework](https://github.com/Simsilica/SiO2)
- [SimEthereal framework](https://github.com/Simsilica/SimEthereal)
- [Pager framework](https://github.com/Simsilica/Pager)

Thanks to the Subspace/Continuum developers who keeps the game alive. If not for them, this java port would not be here.
